# AVR-MCU-Library
بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيم...  
  
##Welcome to my AVR C / C++ Library Page.  

This page is a collection of AVR microcontroller programs or libraries that I collect, modify, or create.  
All Libraries that I collect will rename with an additional pyzXXXX initial.
This is just for common understanding if you share the library from my GitHub.
But to know the link to the website, creator, and other information you can open a file using a text editor.

Suggestions, input, and criticism are welcome.  
Hope it is useful.
